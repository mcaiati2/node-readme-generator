call on it in the init function.
we call on it to give us the generatemarkdown string
in init call on callwriteToFile('fileNameFirstParameter', markdown) <-- markdown came from our generate markdown function

(questions should have your prompts)

init function gets called
first prompts the user to either create a readme file or extension
if they choose to create the file, then prompt them with all of the related questions.
